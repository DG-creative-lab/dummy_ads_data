# Dummy Data Scripts ![alt text](/assets/Super-dummy-data-logo.png)

The idea of this repository is to be a collection of scripts generating dummy data for building and demoing of data visualisatios and ML models. 
The data generated is mainly marketing data. It is really hard to find programmatic, search and campaign data online so these scripts are ment to solve this problem.
The difficulty with advertising data is that it produces really long tables with a lot of related fields. The sripts aim for high level of accuracy in the values between the dependent fields.
However, this is not 100% guaranted, it is dummy data after all. Having said that, the scripts contain simple functions to manipulate the data if you need to achieve a particular insight/KPI or if you need to amend dependency b/w the fields.
